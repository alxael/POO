# Tema 1

## Set up

Please ensure that [CMake](https://cmake.org) and [vcpkg](https://vcpkg.io/en/) are installed on your system. In addition, please ensure that all project dependencies are installed on your system. You can do this by going into the install directory of vcpkg and running the following command: `sudo vcpkg install libpqxx spdlog cryptopp`.

The project uses a local PostgreSQL instance to store data. The project connects to the PostgreSQL database using the `libpqxx` library. The default database it uses to store data is `poo`. If you wish to store data in another database, you may pass it as the first argument to the executable (i.e. if you want to connect to database `test` you may run `./build/tema1 test`).

## Running the project
Once the PostgreSQL instance is running on your system, and you have selected the database you wish to store your data in, build your project by running `cmake --build build`, and then start the project by running `./build/tema1`.

## Logging
All logging in the project is done using the `spdlog` library. The folder `logs` contains the `main.log` file, which stores all logs generated by the project. To print objects you may use standard I/O methods, but the data you print will also appear in the log files.
